## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
final_fire=read.csv('final_wildfire.csv')
summary_nature=read.csv('summary_nature.csv')
summary_peoplecaused=read.csv('summary_peoplecaused.csv')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
hist(summary_nature$FIRE_SIZE)
hist(summary_peoplecaused$FIRE_SIZE)
```


```{r}
boxplot(n~Year,summary_peoplecaused)
boxplot(n~month,summary_peoplecaused)

boxplot(n~Year,summary_nature)
boxplot(n~month,summary_nature)



```
```{r}
boxplot(FIRE_SIZE~Year,summary_peoplecaused)
boxplot(FIRE_SIZE~month,summary_peoplecaused)

boxplot(FIRE_SIZE~Year,summary_nature)
boxplot(FIRE_SIZE~month,summary_nature)

print('the mean of fire size of people caused is')
mean(summary_peoplecaused$FIRE_SIZE)
print('the mean of fire size of natural reasons is')
mean(summary_nature$FIRE_SIZE)


```

```{r}
cor_nature=cor(summary_nature[c(4:8)])

library(corrplot)
corrplot(cor_nature,method='number')


```
